# Sensory TV 2.0 Remote Troubleshooting

## Common Issues

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|---------|
| Remote not pairing | Ensure TV supports Bluetooth or IR, turn off/on both devices, retry pairing |
| No audio feedback | Check speaker volume, battery level, ensure device is not muted |
| Buttons not responding | Replace/recharge battery, restart TV, retry commands |
| Voice commands not recognized | Speak clearly, ensure microphone is unobstructed, check pairing |


## Testing Features
- **Braille Keypad:** Press buttons; TV should respond (e.g., channel change, volume adjustment).  
- **Voice Recognition:** Speak commands; TV should execute them.  
- **Video Recording:** Say “Record room” and rotate remote; LED blinks yellow, speaker confirms recording.  
- **Speaker:** Ask “Battery level”; speaker announces it.  

> Tip: Always ensure Sensory TV 2.0 battery is charged and pairing mode is active before troubleshooting.
